# operators

#  arithmetic operators

# x + y     addition
# x - y     subtraction
# x * y     multiplication
# x / y     division
# x % y     modulus
# x ** y    exponentiation
# x // y    floor division

# assignment operators

x = 5
x += 5      # x = x + 5
x -= 5      # x = x - 5
x *= 5      # x = x * 5
x /= 5      # x = x / 5
x %= 5      # x = x % 5
x //= 5     # x = x // 5
x **= 5     # x = x ** 5
x &= 5      # x = x & 3
x |= 3      # x = x | 3
x ^= 3      # x = x ^ 3
x >>= 3     # x = x >> 3
x <<= 3     # x = x << 3

# comparison operators

# x == y      # equal
# x != y      # not equal
# x > y       # greater than
# x < y       # less than
# x >= y      # greater than or equal to
# x <= y      # less than or equal to

# logical operators

# and       # returns True if both statements are true
# or        # returns True if one of the statements are true
# not       # reverse the result, returns False if the result is true

# identity operators

# is        # returns True if both variables are the same object
# is not    # returns True if both variables are not the same object

# membership operators

# in        # returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
# not in    # returns True if a sequence with the specified vale is not present in the object

# bitwise operators

# & 	AND                         Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# |	    OR	                        Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
# ^ 	XOR	                        Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# ~ 	NOT	                        Inverts all the bits
# <<	Zero fill left shift	    Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
# >>	Signed right shift	        Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
